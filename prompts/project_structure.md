# Base off my project structure where would you put hte pyproject.toml

Based on your project structure, you should place the pyproject.toml file in the root directory, alongside your README.md and .gitignore. This is the standard location for Python project configuration files.

Here's how to add it:

```
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "games_rule_chatbot"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A chatbot that will be able to answer questions about games that it has the rules of"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
dependencies = [
    "google-adk",  # For Google Agent Development Kit
    "pinecone-client",  # For vector database
    "langchain",  # For RAG implementation
    "pydantic",  # For data modeling
    "fastapi",  # For MCP server
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest",
    "black",
    "ruff",
    "mypy"
]

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py39"

[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ["py39"]

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.9"
strict = true
```

This will be your project's central configuration file, managing dependencies, build settings, and development tools. The root directory is the most logical place since:

It's easily discoverable
It's at the same level as other configuration files (.gitignore)
It follows Python project standard practices
Tools like pip, poetry, and IDEs expect to find it there

# What if my project will have multiple libraries and have infrastructure included?

I'll help you structure your project to handle multiple libraries and infrastructure code. Here's a recommended project structure:

```
games_rule_chatbot/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── libs/
│   ├── core/                    
│   │   ├── pyproject.toml
│   │   └── src/
│   │       └── games_rule_core/
│   ├── mcp/                      
│   │   ├── pyproject.toml
│   │   └── src/
│   │       └── games_rule_mcp/
│   └── vector_store/            
│       ├── pyproject.toml
│       └── src/
│           └── games_rule_vector/
├── infra/
│   ├── terraform/               
│   │   ├── environments/
│   │   │   ├── dev/
│   │   │   └── prod/
│   │   └── modules/
│   └── kubernetes/             
│       ├── base/
│       └── overlays/
├── tests/                      
│   └── e2e/
├── scripts/                    
│   ├── setup.sh
│   └── deploy.sh
└── docker/                     
    ├── Dockerfile.api
    └── Dockerfile.mcp
```

I'll create the root pyproject.toml that will reference the other libraries:

```
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "games_rule_chatbot"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A chatbot that will be able to answer questions about games that it has the rules of"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
dependencies = [
    "games-rule-core",
    "games-rule-mcp",
    "games-rule-vector"
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0",
    "pytest-cov",
    "black",
    "ruff",
    "mypy",
    "pre-commit"
]

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py39"

[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ["py39"]

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.9"
strict = true

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
addopts = "-ra -q --cov"
```

And here's an example of one of the library's pyproject.toml:

```
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "games-rule-core"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Core business logic for the games rule chatbot"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
dependencies = [
    "google-adk",
    "pydantic>=2.0",
    "typing-extensions>=4.0"
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest",
    "black",
    "ruff",
    "mypy"
]
```

Update your README.md to reflect the new structure:


## Games Rule Chatbot

A chatbot that will be able to answer questions about games based on their rules.

### Project Structure

```
libs/           # Internal libraries
├── core        # Core business logic
├── mcp         # MCP server implementation
└── vector      # Vector database operations

infra/          # Infrastructure code
├── terraform/  # IaC configurations
└── kubernetes/ # K8s manifests
```

### Development

1. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Deployment

See `infra/` directory for deployment configurations.


### And add a pre-commit configuration:

```
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: check-added-large-files

-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.12.1
    hooks:
    -   id: black

-   repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.1.11
    hooks:
    -   id: ruff
        args: [--fix]

-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v1.8.0
    hooks:
    -   id: mypy
        additional_dependencies: [types-all]
```

This structure:

- Separates concerns into distinct libraries
- Makes infrastructure code first-class
- Supports multiple environments
- Includes proper testing setup
- Uses modern Python tooling
